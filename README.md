# Mobile Phone Sales(Onyx)

## Introduction

At the beginning of my data analysis journey, I started with Excel, using the **Onyx Data DNA May Mobile Phone Sales dataset** as a practical resource for hands-on practice. The key concepts I explored included pivot table calculations and inserting charts for data visualization.

## Problem Statement

- Which **brands** generate the highest revenue and unit sales?
-	What **storage size** and **mobile models** are most popular among customers?
-	How do **sales channels** (online, retail, partner) contribute to total transactions?
-	Which **customer demographics** (age, gender) drive the most revenue?
-	Which **cities** generate the highest sales performance?
-	How can management use these insights to **improve sales strategy and resource allocation**?

## Skilled Demonstrated

-	**Data Cleaning & Transformation:** Handling missing values, removing duplicates, and preparing structured data.
-	**Excel Functions & Pivot Tables:** Aggregating and summarizing key metrics.
-	**Data Visualization:** Using charts, slicers, and dashboards for storytelling.
-	**Business Intelligence & Analysis:** Identifying trends, patterns, and insights from data.
